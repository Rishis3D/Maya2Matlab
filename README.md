# Maya2Matlab

This Maya plugin allows one writing MATLAB code in MAYA's attribute editor DIRECTLY.
It defines a matlab node in maya. 
One can send polygon mesh data to the node, perform some computation and send the result back to maya.
All you need is connecting nodes, writing MATLAB code in maya interface and waiting for the result.
